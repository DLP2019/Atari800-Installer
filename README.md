## Reference Guides

Atari800 ships with built-in AltirraOS. This provides Atari BIOSes for the emulated machines and it provides Atari BASIC.

Altirra is an Atari emulator for Windows. It is different to the Atari800 emulator installed by this script. However, if you are interested, for reference purposes there is an [Altirra Hardware Reference Manual](http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/Altirra%20Hardware%20Reference%20Manual.pdf) and [Altirra BASIC Reference Manual](http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/Altirra%20BASIC%20Reference%20Manual.pdf) available for download.
